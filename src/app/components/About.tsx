          Hi, I&apos;m Mai! ðŸ‘‹

          I&apos;m a software engineer who loves creating products for users of
          all. My journey stemmed from my first financial analyst job where I
          was working on automating reports.

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          I specialize in{" "}
          <strong>
            implementing functionalities between front-end and back-end{" "}
          </strong>{" "}
          using technologies like React and Next.js. For example, grabbing a
          button from the UI and adding life to it so it can submit information
          to be captured in the backend. I&apos;m also constantly exploring new
          tools and techniques to expand my skillset, such as V0, Bolt, Remix,
          and so many more.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Beyond coding, I Love eating, exploring, and trying new activities.
          One of my biggest goal is to eat through all of LA and I am sure I
          barely made a dent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Thanks for stopping by on my portfolio road trip! I&apos;m excited to
          share my projects with you.
