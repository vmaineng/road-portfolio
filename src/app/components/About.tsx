          Hi, I&apos;m Mai! ðŸ‘‹
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          I&apos;m a software engineer who loves automating . My journey into
          software engineering stemmed from my first financial analyst job where
          I was working on automating financial reports.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          I specialize in{" "}
          <strong>
            implementing functionalities between front-end and back-end with
            automation{" "}
          </strong>{" "}
          using technologies like React and Next.js. Coming from a financial
          analyst background, I&apos;m always looking for ways to automate
          processes from documentation to implementing new features.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Beyond coding, I Love eating, exploring, and trying new activities.
          One of my biggest goal is to eat through all of LA and I am sure I
          barely made a dent. So many good food to chose from!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Thanks for stopping by on my portfolio road trip! I&apos;m excited to
          share my projects with you.
